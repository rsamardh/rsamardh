## mini-manifesto on AI usage and business ethics
using AI will just kill my own ability to think. as a philosophically inclined person, i believe that i shouldn't skimp out on doing the things that make it cool to be human. 

this is my anti-generative AI pledge, and a snippet of my vision for a more ethical free market.

regardless of how much faster the project will get done, i want my work to be a labor of love at all times. regardless of how easily i can condense lengthy documentation, i want to have the endurance and resourcefulness to do it myself. the list goes on forever. 

it's shameful for me as a human to admit that an imitative machine could create better stuff than me.

however, i am not a doomer in terms of technological progress. i believe that we are caught in a loop where contractors and businesses sell only to each other, and all consumer facing products/services have turned into monopolies/knockoffs or data harvesting farms (think twitter/x and bluesky or amazon and temu). B2B work these days largely feels meaningless, because the likelihood of seeing the end consumer benefit directly from one's own work is... simply put, non-existent. saving some company money that will go directly into investor dividends and executive paychecks is disheartening for the regular employee.

that being said, i believe that change is possible. beginning with small, meaningful projects that expect little to nothing in return. 

it starts with bootstrapping and refusing to IPO to protect your values from vulturous venture capitalists sucking the life out of your company as it grows. it starts with nodding and going "okay, good work everyone" after the fiscal report shows no improvement from last year (because *why* again did you start this company? for unreasonable expectations of constant profit growth? or to make an impact?).

at which point do we accept that we've done enough? at which point does an excellent performance review lead to a raise?

as knowledge workers, it's easy to fall into the "doing my job, listening to orders" trap. but we live in a world where technocracy and inane, infinite greed runs rampant.

do what you need to do. feed yourself. put a roof over your head. i'm not against jobs.

but take accountability. do what you can. do *not* believe them. do *not* surrender.
