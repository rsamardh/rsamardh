## hey there 👋
my name is samardh. i'm a trans guy from hyderabad who likes to code and organize stuff.

read my "manifesto" (dunno if i should call it that) on AI, startup culture, and corporate accountability [here](./manifesto.md)

what i've discovered in my coding journey thus far:
- i like working with data (csv and sql so far) using python
- i dislike frontend development.
- i like backend development (apis/scripts/automation)
- i dislike webpage bloat (unnecessarily complex web design to make thing look shiny)
- i like tools that do their job well without overcommitting to make their product expensive
- i dislike venture capital & startup culture
- i like user-focused operational pipelines
- i dislike predatory softwares and sites

this is not an exhaustive list, but i hope it conveys the basics about me.
